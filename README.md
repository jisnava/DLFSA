The Fragment_Library Folder contains codes for Library Creation of various length fragments.

Implementation of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 mentioned in the paper can be seen in respective folders.

homosapiens_pdbid - contains the pdbid of proteins taken for fragment library creation

parallel_pdb_files_downloader.py - code for parallelly downloading a number of pdb files from RCSB-PDB repository(file name containing the list of pdbid's must be give according to the program)

MODEL - folder contains the notebook for CNN model and the saved weights to recteate the results.

Files needed for doing sample testing is provided in Testing Files inside the MODEL folder.

Some of the Extra Codes for fixing the library creation(if needed) are given in Fixing-Fragments folder

Accuracy and Loss plots for the model are also given.
